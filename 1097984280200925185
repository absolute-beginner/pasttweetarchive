Text of the tweet: I LOVE giving away free stuff.  When I was flat broke the only entertainment I ever had was free.  It's why I fell in love with YouTube.

Now I am able to support people I love.

Todays "leech" is tommorows subscriber.

But either way be PROUD to entertain people for FREE. https://t.co/Rvp10vp93S

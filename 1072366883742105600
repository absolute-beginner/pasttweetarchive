Text of the tweet: No thanks.  I disagree entirely.  I believe she should not have been doing that in front of her kids, but provided that they're in an ongoing abusive relationship shit like that's bound to happen eventually.

I just wish she didn't do it in front of the kids. https://t.co/oe7cQ4iCUt

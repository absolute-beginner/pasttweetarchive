Text of the tweet: The left IS more worthy of criticism.  Let me explain.

I feel that the left's ideal of equality is common sense.  I feel like it should win any debate.  The only way it CAN LOSE is if people on the left act like lunatics.

Inequality is logic-less and will fall apart on its own. https://t.co/QHCypJo1M1

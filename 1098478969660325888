Text of the tweet: OK.  I like parts of anthem.  Other parts, not so much.  Tonight after the day 1 patch hit we discovered this rendering bug which apparantly happens when someone who created the instance leaves.  Devs are working on it.

Might advise you to wait to buy after seeing this. https://t.co/ISSFDZZfys

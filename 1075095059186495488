Text of the tweet: Allow me to clarify.

I love freedom of speech.  I want to celebrate that right as much as Alex Jones does.  I will stand up for it too.

But forgive me for wanting to stand as far away from Alex as I can be in the crowd.

I want to celebrate my freedom of speech very differently https://t.co/dwbpGfX47t

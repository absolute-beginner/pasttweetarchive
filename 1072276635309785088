Text of the tweet: Mostly web design and search engine optimization.  I also built a bunch of blogs and had them outsourced for content to help SEO.

Basically i sold referral memberships via affiliate links, spammed google, ran a link site, outsourced some blogs and designed front ends for ladies. https://t.co/GADMppBXpw

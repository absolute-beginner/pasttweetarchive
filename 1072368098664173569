Text of the tweet: Nope.  I do condemn both of them for doing it in front of their kids.  I havent changed my mind on that.

Doing this in front of their kids is very, very bad.  Hitting your spouse is far, far worse.

But "hang them both" was hyperbole.  Sorry for using it there. https://t.co/jcR2HfLwjb

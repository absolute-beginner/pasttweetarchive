Text of the tweet: The way I see it you cant possibly expect a fan to keep up with everything.  Merch. Sponsors.  Subs.  Patreon.  I wouldn't want you too do them all, honestly.  Too much.

But giving fans options is the way to go.  More options there are the better chance they engage. https://t.co/oWmPFntsX8

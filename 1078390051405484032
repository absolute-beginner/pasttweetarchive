Text of the tweet: &lt;3

I laugh about everything.  I dont know why.  I laughed while giving my moms eulogy.  I made jokes during my divorce proceedings.  I will be laughing on my death bed.

It's just how my brain reacts to the really horrible shit.  Idk why.

Feels better than crying tho. https://t.co/Royen2oJ6t

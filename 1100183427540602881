Text of the tweet: I certainly have friends outside of the industry. 

But I find it easier to relate to people with things we have in common.  Gamers.  Youtubers.  Artists.  Film makers.

It's not required.  I have plenty of friends who dont fit that bill.

Sorry if this is offensive somehow https://t.co/q1hLqTeBSs

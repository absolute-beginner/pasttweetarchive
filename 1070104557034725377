Text of the tweet: Nah.  I stick by this one.  Diversity in games is good.  But please make sure the game itself is good and don't market off the back of diversity.  Market off the back of the quality of your game.

But please give me diversity: in color, lifestyle, sexual preference, gender, etc. https://t.co/70UUiwOPdC

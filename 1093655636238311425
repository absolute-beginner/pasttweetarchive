Text of the tweet: I think its ok to let people be wrong.  I don't think they're right.  I think they're misinformed and incorrect.

Specifically, its OK to think its pointless to have gay video game characters.

But I tolerate that with the hopes that one day I can educate and change their mind. https://t.co/MJQWMBIqtO

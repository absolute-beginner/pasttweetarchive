Text of the tweet: I'm sorry if I am mistaken but it did look like in the clip that she was throwing things and screaming at him.  THAT DOES NOT JUSTIFY HIS ACTIONS AND I CONDEMN THEM AND HIM.

But she shouldn't be doing those things in front of her kids.

But slapping is FAR, FAR worse. Fuck him. https://t.co/1P3sC7uRxj

Text of the tweet: @JDTalks666 Deplorable:  Deserving of strong condemnation.  Shockingly bad in quality.

This business practice SHOULD BE CONDEMNED and is shockingly bad in quality.

I chose that word specifically because it summarizes exactly how I feel.

Stop this practice and bury it, where it belongs.

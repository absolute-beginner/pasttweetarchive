Text of the tweet: For those of you who are misunderstanding what I am trying to say let me clarify.

Stand up for yourself. But be better then the people who harass you. Don't sink to their level. Don't use their awful tactics.

Lead by example and prove them wrong.

 It's the only path to victory

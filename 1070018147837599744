Text of the tweet: My flight was also another 500 and then we had to book a hotel.  So overall this will probably cost me about 2000 bucks.  That's a LOT of money.  I'd never say otherwise.  Its worth every penny.  both as a business expense and a christmas present to myself.  Why is that upsetting

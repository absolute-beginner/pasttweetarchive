Text of the tweet: This is not me over-reacting.

A video game that costs 60 dollars, then has a 50 dollar season pass, then a paid battle pass system, as well as direct purchase of cosmetic items.... should NOT add loot boxes.

This is a worse case scenario and should be shamed as one. https://t.co/FCqSYLfRfK

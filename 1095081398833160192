Text of the tweet: For those of you wondering why I never made a new video about @Eugenia_Cooney its simple.

I have struggled with an eating disorder my whole life.

I know how terrible negative attention can be.

I didnt want to draw more of that attention to her.

Still glad she is getting help.

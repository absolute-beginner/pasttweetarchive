Text of the tweet: First off saying something like this doesnt mean I do not mean it when i say i love you guys.  I do.

This is a "STREAM MEME".  It's a joke.  We had a dude talk about his parents getting divorced in a stream a few months back so we carried it over.

It is not meant seriously. https://t.co/kXFUtSjMRK

Text of the tweet: I will never stand by something i said that is wrong. 

I am eager to learn.  Eager to grow.  Eager to become a better person and better ally.

When I take a misstep I wont keep walking the wrong path if someone can reason with me and show me it doesnt lead where I want to go. https://t.co/2cQ779FyjC

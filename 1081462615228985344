Text of the tweet: @RenoKizzer I remember a Magic the Gathering  Tournament where my ex wife was harassed for not really knowing how to play the game. It's awful this stuff happens.

But harassment has happened to me too at events.  It happens to us all.  It's part of competion and the human experience.

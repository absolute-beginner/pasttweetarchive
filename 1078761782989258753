Text of the tweet: I hear you.

I have experienced so much cyber bullying this last year that it has made me suicidal at points.  It got me back into therapy though and my therapist is trying to teach me that exact thing to help cope.

Yet I still dont want to take their right to bully away. https://t.co/VP0UAEqDcD

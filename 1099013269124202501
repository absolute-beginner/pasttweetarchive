Text of the tweet: This is... scary?

You are putting into an audience's hands the ability to demonitize a video.

I have been brigades before and as a large channel I doubt they could tilt this in their favor.

But a smaller channel?  Should be easy for bots or a brigade to do.

Be. Careful. https://t.co/MHrp7sG70q

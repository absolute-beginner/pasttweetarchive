Text of the tweet: I hear ya.  Lost my best friend and dad to cancer.  Had skin cancer myself.

I joke about cancer because it's my way of dealing with the pain its caused.  I choose to laugh in its goddamned face.

I am sorry if those jokes cause you pain though.  Love you. https://t.co/zKZ3K5KMwo

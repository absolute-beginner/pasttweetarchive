Text of the tweet: @icklenellierose I hear you and I fully understand.  Know I got nothing but love and respect for what you have achieved.  Please keep being awesome.

Sorry if my tweet came across as man-splaining or snarky.  It was meant to be supportive and loving tho I get how it can be seen as otherwise.

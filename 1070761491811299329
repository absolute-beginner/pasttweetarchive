Text of the tweet: There are a bunch of right wing bigot attacking me as well as some left wing people who think I am some sort of monster.  Its exhausting.

At least hating me is something they have in common I guess.  Neutral ground.  It's a start.

Maybe hating me is where the healing begins. https://t.co/YxH4bciB4r

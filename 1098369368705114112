Text of the tweet: Not at all.  Watch my review.  I thought it was like a 5/10.  Just a run of the mill comedy.  The villian was horribly boring but the rest of it had its moment.  Kate McKinnon was GREAT.  

it had its ups and downs.  I'm still excited for the 'sequel' and not the 'reboot' tho. https://t.co/s1nITkjSa8

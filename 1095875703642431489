Text of the tweet: I get that some people can find jokes about divorced parents being offensive. I understand that.

 The guy in the video did not however. Don't one I've played with so far has.

 I clearly understand you and a lot of people on reddit do not like that kind of joke though. https://t.co/xx4vS4PmR9

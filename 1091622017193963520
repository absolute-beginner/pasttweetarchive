Text of the tweet: @tha_rami I'm with you. When a service does the publishing and everything I understand they deserve some money for that.

 But as a consumer I would prefer it was as little as possible to keep the service running. I want the dev to get the rest.

 It's why I also buy merch, ce's, etc

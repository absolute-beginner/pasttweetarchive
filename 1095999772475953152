Text of the tweet: @Oak_Andrea @initialjoji I honestly don't know what I mean any more.

 I'm just exhausted from dealing with this hate all day.

I'm sorry that people were so offended by the joke but it was just a joke and I would never bully anybody.

 I'm not sorry for the joke I am sorry that it failed so badly

Text of the tweet: @j_bloom_ @FlyingOverTr0ut Yeah he won't let it go unfortunately.

I had him blocked for over a year but he just kept on tweeting and tweeting so I unblocked him.

I feel really bad for him, honestly.

I guess I might block him again at some point. :/

I used to consider him a friend so I put up with him.

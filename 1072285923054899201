Text of the tweet: @renderific I'll trust your expertise here as a woman.  I can't really say from that perspective.

As a man whose abuser was a woman, I can say I never thought that way.  I just wanted to get as far away as possible as soon as possible myself.  Seemed to be the best course of action.

Text of the tweet: Spider-Man was a really great game.  It kind of got outclassed tho this year.

But you are right that marvel stuff is very saturated.

Worse is that the game used the Marvel formula pretty closely.

2 much better stories came out in the same year. 

But Damn spidey was fun! https://t.co/O6FiSu5Ok8

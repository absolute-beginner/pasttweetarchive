Text of the tweet: @JennyENicholson @Totalbiscuit Not that he woulsnt befriend you lol.  He wasnt elietist.

He was just saying it was easier to make friends with creators than it was someone who doesnt understand the field.  You have to explain so much to someone outside the Industry to discuss the industry itself.

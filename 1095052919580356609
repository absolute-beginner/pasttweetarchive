Text of the tweet: Except that isnt the time line.

I tweeted it.  Then someone said I stole it and showed me his tweet.  I liked his tweet to show that I saw it and to give him credit for it after people pointed it out.

 Why would I lie about something like this? It's Internet points. Who cares. https://t.co/DWbAI0uBZA

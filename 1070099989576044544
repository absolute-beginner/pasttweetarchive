Text of the tweet: Battlefield 5's marketing was based on inclusiveness, scaring away potential customers, instead of on it being a good game.

Then the game was released unfinished.  Few maps. few modes.  Many modes not to be released til sometime next year.  Full price game. with Micros. https://t.co/oww9mZ2H5U
